"""
***WORK IN PROGRESS, UNFINISHED***


In this stage, create a database named card.s3db with a table titled card. It should have the following columns:

id INTEGER
number TEXT
pin TEXT
balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0
Pay attention: your database file should be created when the program starts, if it hasnâ€™t yet been created. 
And all created cards should be stored in the database from now.
